truthtable.py is a program that generates a truthtable for a propositional statement.
truthtable.py should be run as a whole rather than its individual function.

When run, the program lists the syntax for different operators used in logical expressions:

Operator syntax:
and
or
not (can be written either as "-" or "not")
imp = implication
bimp = bi-implication
xor: exclusive or

Leave space between operators and non-operators to avoid error-based termination

---------------------------
propositional_relations.py calculates relations for expressions.
Expressions should be in the form of strings with the same syntax explained in the truthtable program.
